# This is a project file template for the SEISART software. In order to run the
# model for seismic, electromagnetic or both, the required inputs must be 
#
# Domain Input Values:
#	dim 		- STR; either '2' or '2.5' but default is '2'
#	nx,ny,nz 	- INT; the dimensions of the image. If dim = 2.5, and ny is 
#			  empty then default ny=1
#	dx,dy,dz	- REAL; the spatial step size for each dimension in meters. If
#			  dim = 2.5 and dy is empty then default dy=min(dx,dz)
#
# Material Input Values:
#	id 		- INT; the identifier given to each unique rgb value as it
#			  is read into the computer. It's recommended to use this 
#			  script to make sure it's sorted correctly.
#	R/G/B 		- STR; the 0-255 values for each color code. 
#	Temperature 	- REAL; temperature in Celsius.
#	Attenuation 	- REAL; (placeholder) will be attenuation length soon.
#	Density 	- REAL; density in kg/m^3 
#	Porosity 	- REAL; percent porosity
#	Water_Content 	- REAL; percent of pores that contain water
#	Anisotropic 	- BOOL; whether the material is anisotropic (True) or 
#			  isotropic (False).
#	ANG_File 	- STR; if Anisotrpic is True then the full path to the 
#			  .ang file is supplied. The .ang file is a delimited text
#			  file that contains the 3-by-n array of euler rotation 
#			  angles in radians.
#	
#		or alternatively...
#	C11-C66 	- REAL; the stiffness coefficients with the appropriate id
#	E11-E33,S11-S33	- REAL; the permittivity and conductivity coefficients and
#			  'id' value corresponding to the coefficients along the diagonal 
#			  of their respective tensors. 
#	
#
# Source Input Values:
#	dt 		- REAL; dx/(2*maxvelcity)
#	steps 		- INT; the total number of time steps
#	x,y,z 		- REAL; locations in meters, +z is down, +y is into the screen
#	f0 		- REAL; center frequency for the guassian pulse function if 
#			  'source_file' isn't supplied
#	theta 		- REAL; source orientation in the x-z plane, 
#	phi 		- REAL; source orientation in the x-y plane for 2.5/3D only,  
#	source_file	- STR; the pointer to the text file that contains the source 
#			  timeseries as a steps-by-1 vector.
