## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The Seismic and Radar Toolbox (SEISART) is a collaboration between researchers at the Universities of Maine and Washington to provide an open source platform for forward modeling mechanical and electromagnetic wave propagation. The major objective of the project is to easily and quickly implement isotropic and anisotropic complex geometries and/or velocity structures to develop prior constraints for - not limited too - investigating, estimating, and imaging englacial ice structure, sub-glacial boundary conditions on the sub-regional scale. Larger problems would require the curvature of the Earth to be taken into consideration, but many glacier seismic and radar experiments do not expand into regional parameter estimation and velocity modeling. 

Much of this code has been adopted from the *SEISMIC_CPML* software provided by [Computational Infrastucture for Geophysics (CIG)](https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/). Further details to the backend numerical code can be found in the [References](#references) section below.
