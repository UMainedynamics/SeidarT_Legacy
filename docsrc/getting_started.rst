Understanding model inputs
******************************

* *PNG image (.png)*

    This defines the geometry of your model system. A good starting size is
    50 to 500 pixels for each direction. Each RGB color represents a different
    material, so **the file must be saved with no antialiasing**.


* *receiver locations (text file, commonly receivers.xyz)*

    This is a comma separated list of X,Y,Z coordinates (one set per line,
    with X,Y,Z as the first line) for receiver locations. Can use pixels, but
    more typically meters as the units.


* *project file (.prj)*

    Defines domain values, material properties, and source values for
    electromagnetic and seismic runs. Used when running the model, which
    fills in the permittivity and conductivity coefficients for the seismic
    and electromagnetic model runs respectively. This file is generated by
    the prjbuild command.

Initiating a project
************************

Geometries for the model domain within SeidarT are initiated with a
PNG image. The program identifies unique RGB values, setting material
properties for each. For example, if you wanted to define a geometry
with ice overlying bedrock, you would create a .png image that is one
color for the ice and another for the rock below. Everyone has their
preferences to generate images but |gimp| or |inkscape| provide free
and open software that are more than sufficient.

.. note::

    When creating a PNG, anti-aliasing must be turned off to avoid
    color boundary gradients.

Building images in Inkscape has some advantages other than being free.
Saving a .svg to pdf allows the user to change the number of pixels
and the spatial resolution of the image quite easily. With
ghostscript, the command ::

    gs -q -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=png16m -sOutputFile=<file> -r96 <input_file>

will generate a PNG file from a PDF. The resolution :code:`-r` can be
varied to change the pixels. In Inkscape, the image pixels can be set
in Document Properties. When saving the SVG as PDF, you will be
prompted with options, and the value for Resolution for rasterization
(dpi): will determine - in order to get the same pixel setting that
you set in Inkscape - the value for the :code:`-r` (resolution) option
above. If you want to double the resolution, just double this number
(i.e. :code:`-r192`).

To get started on a new project create a new folder and save the image
to the folder. From the command line, change directories to the
project folder then enter the following::

    prjbuild -i /path/to/geometry/image.png -o project_filename.prj

The project filename is optional; if the :code:`-o` option is omitted
then the default text file "jordan_downs.prj" will be generated.
For any of the executables the :code:`-h` or :code:`--help` option
will provide a quick reference to any positional, optional or required
arguments.

Using the text editor of choice, you can edit the .prj file.
