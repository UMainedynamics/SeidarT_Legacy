SeidarT is a powerful numerical modeling tool to calculate englacial
seismic and electromagnetic wave propagation. Though it grew out
of a desire to simulate field surveys in glaciers and ice sheets, the
code is general enough for any Earth material.

    An example of model output calculated by SeidarT, showing wave
    propagation through multiple material types along the X-Z plane and
    complex geometry between the layers.
